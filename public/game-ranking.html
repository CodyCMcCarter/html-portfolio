<h2>3 Games I'll Always Remember.</h2>
<span>Picking favorites is hard, so here are 3 games from different points in my life that I remember to this day.</span>

<h3>Vectorman</h3>
<p>A game from my childhood that I never forgot. A fun 2D platformer/shooter for the Sega Genesis.</p>
<h3>Halo 2</h3>
<p>My first modern FPS and a true classic. I still remember LAN parties with friends.</p>
<h3>Ghost of Tsushima</h3>
<p>Just a fantastic game all around. Super solid singleplayer and very fun multiplayer that was added later for free. I love my horse.</p>
