<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cody McCarter. I'm a husband and father of one. I enjoy playing video and tabletop games, spending time with my family,
  and developing web applications. I've been a QA for 10+ years, but have always wanted to make the jump into developing ever since falling
  in love with it in college.</p>
